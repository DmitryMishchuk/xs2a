# XS2A interface –> Core services-> Payment Initiation Service


## AIS_01 Account Information Service (AIS).
This service may be used by an AISP to request information about the account of a PSU. The account is managed by the ASPSP providing the XS2A Interface.


### Account Information Service Flows
The Account Information Service is separated in two phases.


#### Account Information Consent  
PSU is giving consent on
  * the type type of Account Information Service to grant an access to,
  * the Multiplicity of the Account Information Service, i.e. a once-off or
      recurring access, and
  * in the latter case on the duration of the consent in days or as maximally
      offered by the ASPSP and optionally the frequency of a recurring request.
      

    With Redirect SCA Approach
    If the ASPSP supports the Redirect SCA Approach, the message flow within the Account
    Information Consent sub-service is simple. The Account Information Consent Request is
    followed by a redirection to the ASPSP SCA authorisation site. A status or content request
    on the created consent resource might be requested by the TPP after the session is reredirected
    to the TPP’s system.

#### Read Account Data  
The AISP gets access to the account data as defined by the PSU's consent. The Read Account Data Request will indicate 
  * the type of the account data to be accessed
  * in case of transaction reports additionally the addressed account number and the period of the transaction report 
  * the preferred formats of the transaction reports

### Data overview Account Information Service
The following table defines the technical description of the abstract data model as defined for the account information service. The columns give an overview on the API
protocols as follows:

* The **"Data element"** column is using the abstract data elements to deliver the connection to rules and role definitions.
* The **"Attribute encoding"** is giving the actual encoding definition within the XS2A API.
* The **"Location"** columns define, where the corresponding data elements are transported as https parameters, resp. are taken from e-IDas certificates. There are:
    * Path
    * Header
    * Body
    * Certificate
* The **"Usage"** column gives an overview on the usage of data elements in the different services and API Calls. These calls will be technically realised as HHTPS POST, PUT and GET commands. There are:
    * Information Consent Request
    * Information Consent Response
    * Update Data Request 
    * Update Data Response
    * Status Request
    * Status Response
    * Read Data Request
    * Read Data Response

The calls are divided into the following calls for Account Information:
* The Information Request which shall be the first API Call for every
      transaction within the corresponding XS2A Payment Initiation service. 
* The Update Data Call is a call, where the TPP needs to add PSU related
      data, which is requested in the return of the first call. This call might be
      repeated.
* The Get Data Request is the request to retrieve Account Information data.
* The Status Request is used in cases, where the SCA control is taken
      over by the ASPSP and the TPP needs later information about the
      outcome.

The following usage of abbreviations in the Location and Usage columns is defined:
* x: This data element is transported on the corresponding level.
* m: Mandatory
* o : Optional for the TPP to use
* c: Conditional. The Condition is described in the API Calls, condition defined by
  the ASPSP

##### Response Body
| Attribute | Type  | Condition | Description |
|--------|------------------|----------|---------|
| sca_methods | Array of authentication objects |	conditional |	This data element might be contained, if SCA is required and if the PSU has a choice between different authentication methods. Depending on the risk management of the ASPSP this choice might be offered before or after the PSU has been identified with the first relevant factor, or if an access token is transported. If this data element is contained, then there is also an hyperlink of type "select_authentication_methods" contained in the response body. These methods shall be presented towards the PSU for selection by the TPP. |
| chosen_sca_method | authentication object  |	conditional |	This data element is only contained in the response if the APSPS has chosen the Embedded SCA Approach, if the PSU is already identified with the first relevant factor or alternatively an access token, if SCA is required and if the authentication method is implicitly selected.  |
| sca_challenge_data | challenge | conditional | It is contained in addition to the data element chosen_sca_method if challenge data is needed for SCA. 
| _links | links  |	Mandatory |	A list of hyperlinks to be recognized by the TPP. Type of links admitted in this response, (further links might be added for ASPSP defined extensions): *"redirect"* : In case of an SCA Redirect Approach, the ASPSP is transmitting the link  to which to redirect the PSU browser. *"update_psu_identification"* : The link to the payment initiation resource, which needs to be updated by the psu identification. This  might be used in a redirect or decoupled approach, where the PSU ID was missing in the first request. *"update_psu_authentication"* : The link to the payment initiation resource, which need to be updated by a psu password and  eventually the psu identification if not delivered yet. This is used in a case of the Embedded SCA approach.  *"select_authentication_method"* : This is a link to a resource, where the TPP can select  the applicable strong customer authentication methods for the PSU, if there  were several available authentication methods. This link contained under exactly the same conditions as the data element “authentication_methods”, see above. *“status”*: The link to retrieve the transaction status of the payment initiation |
| psu_message | String  |	Optional | Text to be displayed to the PSU |
